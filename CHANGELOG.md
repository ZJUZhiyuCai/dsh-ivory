[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Add independent copy controls for prose paragraphs, user text bubbles, and
  code blocks, including exact code whitespace, accessible success/error
  feedback, and a selection-based fallback when Clipboard API access fails.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-08-16

### Fixed

- Recolor the hero preview badge with theme-relative neutral tokens, removing
  the fixed blue fill and restoring strong dark-mode contrast.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-08-16

### Fixed

- Keep the composer send button visually identical before and after text entry
  in both light and dark themes; only its functional disabled state changes.

### Added

- Complete warm-neutral light and dark themes for DSH web.
- Responsive home, sidebar, conversation, composer, and settings layouts.

  coexistence handling.
